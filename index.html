         <p> After recieving my Bachlor's degree I went directly into social work. I was in this field for about about 3.5 years, but found that it was time to follow one of my dreams and turn my hobby into a career. On a core and fundamental level, I realized that I love to help people. So, I found another way to help people through creating and streamlining websites. Web development was the perfect marriage of my hobbies, interests, and goals that allowed me to stay motivated by helping people. Months later, I found myself at the UT Bootcamp. Within 6 months I was a certfied Full-Stack Developer harnessing skills that allowed me to create this website. Thank you for visitng my page and playing a role in my career change.
